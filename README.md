# Firebase Cloud Function Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a race condition in a Firebase Cloud Function that leads to inconsistent updates in a Realtime Database.  The function attempts to update multiple database nodes concurrently, without proper synchronization, resulting in unpredictable behavior.

## Problem

A Cloud Function triggered by Realtime Database events attempts to update multiple nodes concurrently. The order of these updates is not guaranteed, and if the updates are interdependent, the final state of the database might be inconsistent.

## Solution

The solution involves using transactions or batch updates to guarantee atomicity of operations. This ensures that either all updates succeed, or none do, preventing race conditions and maintaining data consistency.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure Firebase (see Firebase documentation).
4. Deploy the function: `firebase deploy --only functions`
